# MachineLearning

Welcome to Monika's Machine Learning repository. The intend is to showcase some of my favorite projects:

* **Classification problem:**
  - I have shown two examples under this category. 
    
    -- Example I: This is a very simple case of recommending best airlines based on the number of cancellations it has had in the past. 
    
    -- Example II: This is a more complex example of classification type Machine Learning problem simply because there is a severe class imbalance in the data set. I have demonstrated that in the first iteration I am not able to achieve good metrics for any of the models used. So I completely change the methodology and start from scratch. Second time around, I train my models based on equal number of failure and non-failure cases which renders much improved confusion matrix scores. 
    
*  **Natural Language Processing:**
  - Shows Machine Learning models used for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here numerous text messages are identified as ham or spam.
